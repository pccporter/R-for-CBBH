<p>Today we are going to get acquainted with <code>R</code>. A
convenient way to work with <code>R</code> is through
<code>RStudio</code> which adds many features and convenient options to
the plain <code>R</code> interface. Most of these features go beyond the
scope of this course, but as you will develop your <code>R</code>
skillset, you might run into the need for them and hence
<code>RStudio</code> so it is worthwhile to get to know
<code>RStudio</code> right from the beginning.</p>
<p>If you have no experience with <code>R</code>, you will learn the
most from following this document step by step. If you have some
experience with <code>R</code> already, I suggest you try solving the
questions without looking at the answers/walkthrough. You can always
refer to the solutions as needed.</p>
<p>If you have any questions or if you feel that some code should be
elaborated, feel free to ask.</p>
<hr />
<div id="exercises" class="section level4">
<h4>Exercises</h4>
<p>We start with the very basics and will move towards more advanced
operations in <code>R</code>. First we will get acquainted with the
language and the environment we work in.</p>
<hr />
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Open <code>RStudio</code></strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The following window will appear. You might be faced with a bit
different layout, but don’t dispair. Close to everything can be
configured to your likings, including the colour scheme!<br />
<img src="figuresPractical/fig1.png" alt="alt text" /></p>
<p>RStudio is divided in 3 panes, namely the console, the
environment/history pane and the pane where we can access our files,
plots, the help files, make packages and view our data objects. You can
change the order of the panes to your liking through
<code>RStudio</code>’s preferences. I did, that is why your pane layout
might differ from the layout in the above screenshot.</p>
<p>If we open an <code>R</code>-script (i.e. a file that contains
<code>R</code> code), a fourth pane opens.</p>
<hr />
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Create a new <code>R</code>-script</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>In the top left you will find <img src="figuresPractical/fig2.png"
alt="alt text" />. Click it and select <code>R</code>-script. (Real
hackers of course quickly learn the shortcut, Ctrl+Shift+N)</p>
<p>A new pane opens, and we can start typing our code. It is preferable
to work from an <code>R</code>-script instead of directly working in the
console for at least the following reasons (there are many more).</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>You will not lose code, since <code>RStudio</code> caches files even
if they are not saved.</li>
<li>You log your own work. Code does not disappear over time, as you
save the code in a separate file.</li>
<li>With access to your <code>R</code>-script and data, others are able
to exactly reproduce your work. Reproducibility is becoming increasingly
more important, and this is where <code>RStudio</code> really
excells.</li>
<li>You become more organized in coding, as you focus on creating
readable code. In the long run, this will result in you becoming a more
efficient programmer. Remember: efficient code runs faster.</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Type the following in your new
<code>R</code>-script</strong></li>
</ol>
<pre class="r"><code># Exercise 3
a &lt;- 100</code></pre>
<p>The <code>#</code> tells <code>R</code> that everything that follows
in that specific line is not to be evaluated as code. Hence, you can use
the <code>#</code> to create a comment in your <code>R</code>-scripts
(or to temporarily leave out a line of code). I used <code>#</code> here
to elaborate that the following line is the code from exercise 3 (of
practical A).</p>
<p>The line <code>a &lt;- 100</code> assigns the value <code>100</code>
to object <code>a</code>. When you run your code, it will be saved. The
value 100 and the letter <code>a</code> are chosen to illustrate
assigning in <code>R</code>. You might as well assign <code>123</code>
to <code>banana</code> if you like. Really, anything goes.</p>
<hr />
<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Select both lines of code and run the code by pressing
Ctrl+Enter or Ctrl+R</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Your code is executed and now appears in the console. If you type
<code>a</code> in the console, <code>R</code> will return the assigned
value. Try it! <img src="figuresPractical/fig3.png"
alt="alt text" /></p>
<p>The shortcut Ctrl+Enter is your friend: it runs the current
selection, or, if nothing is selected, the current line. If Ctrl+Enter
yields no result, you probably have selected the console pane. You can
switch to the code pane by moving the mouse cursor and clicking on the
desired line in the code pane, or through Ctrl+1. Alternatively, you can
move to the console through Ctrl+2.</p>
<p>You have now succesfully entered and executed your first code snippet
in <code>R</code> by using <code>RStudio</code>.</p>
<hr />
<ol start="5" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Save your code file as <code>Practical_A.R</code> in a
folder named <code>Practicals</code></strong></li>
</ol>
<p>You can use the standard Ctrl+S or click on the icon <img
src="figuresPractical/fig4.png" alt="alt text" /> in the code pane.</p>
<p>Your document is now saved. We saved it in a separate folder so that
we are able to create a project out of our practicals.</p>
<hr />
<ol start="6" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Create a project by clicking on <img
src="figuresPractical/fig5.png" alt="alt text" /> in the top-right
corner of <code>RStudio</code></strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Select “New Project”, click “Existing Directory” and navigate to the
folder where you have just saved your code. When all is done, click on
“Create Project”</p>
<p>You will notice in the files pane that a file
<code>Practicals.RProj</code> has been created</p>
<p><img src="figuresPractical/fig6.png" /></p>
<p>The possibility to organize your work in projects is one of the
benefits of using <code>RStudio</code>. Within a project, everything is
relative to the <code>.Rproj</code> file. This means that if you share
the folder with someone else, this someone only has to open the
<code>.Rproj</code> file to be able to access and run all code and
documents involved with this project. Again, when considering
reproducability of research, working in projects is a huge
advantage.</p>
<hr />
<ol start="7" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Open the <code>R</code>-script
<code>notebook.R</code></strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Download the file (possibly to the same <code>Practicals</code>
directory you just created) and open it in <code>RStudio</code> using
Ctrl+O(pen) and browse to the position where you saved the file .</p>
<hr />
<ol start="8" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Have a look at the code in the script (but don’t run it just
yet!) and try to decipher what is going on.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>If you do not understand what you are looking at, please ask for
help.</p>
<hr />
<ol start="9" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Compile the script as a <code>html</code> file</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Click on the <img src="figuresPractical/fig7.png" alt="alt text" />
icon and select <code>html</code> as the notebook output format.</p>
<p>The benefit of using html as an output format lies in the dimensional
properties of a web-page. Especially when dealing with long code-files,
large output from analyses or many graphs, exporting your file as html
is much more convenient. You can simply scroll down or up to see the
rest, instead of having to flip through pages back and forth to compare
code, graphs or output.</p>
<hr />
<ol start="10" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Inspect the <code>html</code> file you have
created</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The notebook feature in <code>R-Studio</code> is very convenient; it
runs and converts any <code>R</code>-code to a readable file where code
and output are visible. There is, however, an even better format to
integrate <code>R</code>-code with text into a single document:
Markdown!</p>
<hr />
<ol start="11" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Open the file <code>markdown.Rmd</code></strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Have a look at the code in the script and make sure that you
understand what is going on. If you do not understand what you are
looking at, please ask someone for help.</p>
<hr />
<ol start="12" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Click <code>Knit HTML</code> to compile the file into a
html-document.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>If necessary, install the required packages. Inspect the html file
and compare it to the one you have created from the
<code>notebook.R</code> file. Content should be about just the same, but
the layout is nicer and offers many more possibilities.</p>
<p>In the rest of this course we will teach one another about
<code>R</code> by showing our code and the resulting output in the
plenary sessions. The notebook and markdown functionality in
<code>R-Studio</code> are very convenient ways to do this. One of the
reasons for using either format is that we can assess code on every
machine, without the need for the packages / functionality that you used
but someone else might not have. Please use one of these formats for the
other practicals.</p>
<hr />
<ol start="13" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>If not open anymore, open your script by clicking on
<code>Practical_A.R</code> in the files pane. Run both lines of code
again and inspect the contents of the global environment by typing and
running <code>ls()</code></strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The following is returned by <code>R</code></p>
<pre class="r"><code>ls()</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;a&quot;</code></pre>
<p>There is one object in the environment, and it is called
<code>a</code>. If you look at the environment pane, you can quickly see
the corresponding information (i.e. there is no need to type
<code>ls()</code>) and you can see that object <code>a</code> contains a
value. You can even see which value.</p>
<p>A value is the most basic object in <code>R</code>. The next step up
in objects is a vector, followed by a matrix, followed by an array.
Eventually, each of these objects can be stored in a list. We will learn
about vectors, matrices and arrays later today.</p>
<hr />
<p>End of <code>Practical A</code>. Play around with <code>R</code> and
<code>Rstudio</code> if you like. Maybe create a notebook or markdown
template file for the rest of the course? Or try to figure out how to
change the colour scheme for <code>RStudio</code> (always a
favorite!)</p>
